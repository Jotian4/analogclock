# Analog Clock

This project demonstrates a responsive analog clock built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The clock has three functional hands (hour, minute, and second) and displays the current time accurately.

## Features
- Three clock hands:
  - **Hour hand**
  - **Minute hand**
  - **Second hand**
- Updates every second to reflect the current time.
- Fully **responsive** design to adapt to different screen sizes.
- Clean and modern look with minimalistic styling.

## How It Works
1. The `HTML` file contains the static structure of the clock, including div elements for the hands.
2. The `CSS` file styles the clock, ensuring it is centered, responsive, and visually appealing.
3. The `JavaScript` file:
   - Retrieves the current time using the `Date` object.
   - Calculates the position of the clock hands in degrees.
   - Updates the position of the hands using CSS `transform: rotate()` every second.
